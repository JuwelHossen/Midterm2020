Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. To organize data. and efficient way to find data.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
 Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting and Merging

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Database Management System,
Statistical analysis
Numerical Analysis
Artificial Intelligence


what is an Array?
An array is a container that contains a group of elements.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array sized is fixed.
ArrayList size can be increased and decreased

what is LinkedList?



How is an Array different from Linked List?
 LinkedList elements are not stored in contiguous locations like arrays.
 Arrays store ELEMENTS in contiguous location.

what is queue?
Queue represents a data structure designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue or line.

what is stack?
A stack is a container of data inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO: first in first out
LIFO: Last in first out

what is the order of complexity?
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
O(n^2)
O(n^3)
O(n!)

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
O(1)

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
O(n)

what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a representation of the non-linear data structure.consisting of root nod to child node  by edges.

what is graph in data structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values
Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model
RDBMS = Array
Network data model = Graph.
Hierarchical data model = Trees.

How HashMap works in java?
Hash functions are used to link key and value in HashMap.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate
that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index.
When index value greater than array's elements

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Deep copy
Shadow copy
Manually.
Arrays.copyOf()
System.arraycopy()
Object.clone()


What is DFS and BFS?

BFS:(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path.
DFS:(Depth First Search) uses Stack data structure.

What is Recursion?
 A method calls itself is called recursion.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
 In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where
 each and every elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent.
 In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Selection Sort	Ω(n^2)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Bubble Sort	Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Insertion Sort	Ω(n)	θ(n^2)	O(n^2)
Heap Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
Quick Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n^2)
Merge Sort	Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
Bucket Sort	Ω(n+k)	θ(n+k)	O(n^2)
Radix Sort	Ω(nk)	θ(nk)	O(nk)

  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
